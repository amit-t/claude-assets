# YouTube Titles

Generate high-CTR YouTube titles that make people click without misleading them.

## Context Guidelines

- **Voice and tone:** Follow context profiles
- **Business context, audience, and other details:** Refer to any additional context profiles provided

---

## When to Use

- User needs a title for a YouTube video
- User asks for "title ideas" or "YouTube title"
- User wants to test different title angles
- User mentions wanting better CTR or more clicks

---

## Title Philosophy

### The Click Equation

**Click = Curiosity + Relevance + Credibility**

- **Curiosity:** They need to know more
- **Relevance:** It's clearly about something they care about
- **Credibility:** They believe you can deliver

All three must be present. Missing one = weak title.

### Clickbait vs. Click-Worthy

**Clickbait:** Promise something the video doesn't deliver
**Click-worthy:** Create curiosity about something the video actually covers

The difference: Can you deliver on the title's implicit promise?

## Title Patterns That Work

### 1. The Challenge Pattern
Challenge what they think they know.

- "Stop [Common Action] - Do This Instead"
- "[Thing] is Broken. Here's the Fix."
- "Why [Popular Approach] Doesn't Work"
- "The [Topic] Advice Everyone Gets Wrong"

### 2. The Result Pattern
Lead with an outcome or transformation.

- "I [Did Thing] and [Result Happened]"
- "How I [Achieved Result] in [Timeframe]"
- "[X] Changed How I [Do Thing]"
- "From [Before State] to [After State]"

### 3. The Discovery Pattern
Reveal something they don't know.

- "The [Hidden/Secret/Real] Reason [Thing Happens]"
- "What [Experts/Pros] Know About [Topic] That You Don't"
- "[Number] Things I Wish I Knew Before [Starting Thing]"
- "The Truth About [Topic]"

### 4. The Specificity Pattern
Be surprisingly specific.

- "The Exact [Process/Method] I Use to [Result]"
- "My [Specific Number] Step System for [Outcome]"
- "[Specific Tool/Thing] That [Specific Benefit]"
- "How to [Do Thing] in [Specific Timeframe]"

### 5. The Comparison Pattern
Frame choices for them.

- "[Option A] vs [Option B] - Which is Better?"
- "I Tested [X Things] So You Don't Have To"
- "The Best [Category] for [Specific Use Case]"
- "[This] is Better Than [That] for [Purpose]"

### 6. The Story Pattern
Tease a narrative.

- "I [Did Risky/Bold Thing] and Here's What Happened"
- "Why I Quit [Thing] After [Timeframe]"
- "The [Mistake/Lesson] That [Changed Everything]"
- "What Happened When I [Tried/Stopped/Started Thing]"

## Title Optimization Rules

### Length
- **Ideal:** 40-60 characters
- **Maximum:** 70 characters (gets truncated on mobile)
- Front-load important words

### Capitalization
- Title Case or Sentence Case (pick one, be consistent)
- ALL CAPS sparingly, for one word max
- Never all lowercase

### Numbers
- Odd numbers often outperform even
- Specific numbers beat round numbers (17 vs 20)
- "7" and "3" historically perform well
- But don't force it if unnatural

### Power Words
Use sparingly but effectively:
- Urgency: Now, Today, Quick, Fast
- Exclusivity: Secret, Hidden, Little-Known
- Emotion: Shocking, Surprising, Amazing
- Results: Proven, Exact, Complete

### What to Avoid
- Vague titles ("My Thoughts on X")
- Questions that can be answered "no"
- Excessive punctuation!!!???
- Emojis in titles (save for thumbnails)
- Starting with "How to" every time
