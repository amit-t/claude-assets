# LinkedIn Profile Optimizer

**Purpose:** Transform LinkedIn profiles from basic online resumes into powerful personal branding tools that convert visitors into connections and opportunities.

## When to Activate

Use this skill when:
- User asks to optimize their LinkedIn profile
- User mentions "LinkedIn headline", "LinkedIn about section", or specific profile elements
- User wants to attract clients, recruiters, or opportunities via LinkedIn
- User says "improve my LinkedIn" or "LinkedIn profile help"
- User wants comprehensive profile audit and optimization plan

## Core Principle

**LinkedIn profiles should be personal branding tools, not resumes.**

Based on Justin Welsh's proven 8-step framework:
1. Professional Headshot
2. Banner Design
3. Headline Optimization
4. Featured Section
5. About Section
6. Experience Section
7. Content Strategy
8. Recommendations

## Critical: No Fabrication

- **Never create** fictional achievements, metrics, or experiences
- **Only use** information user explicitly provides
- **If gaps exist**: Provide frameworks and ask for details
- **Be adaptive**: Work with whatever level of information user provides

## Workflow

### Step 0: Load Context Profiles

Before starting, load all context profiles provided in the task.

If context profiles exist, use them for voice, business details, and target audience information.

If profiles don't exist, ask user for information directly (see Step 1).

### Step 1: Gather Additional User Information

**Note:** If context profiles loaded, you already have most core information. Ask only for LinkedIn-specific details not in profiles.

### Step 2: Determine Output Level

**Assess information provided:**

**Minimal Input** → Provide:
- Profile audit checklist
- Information gathering worksheet
- Framework templates to fill in
- Industry examples

**Comprehensive Input** → Provide:
- Executive summary of changes
- Priority action items
- Section-by-section copy (ready-to-use)
- Implementation timeline
- Success metrics
