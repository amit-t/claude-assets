# Social Media Bio Generator

**Purpose:** Generate multiple high-converting bio options for LinkedIn, X (Twitter), and Instagram that attract the right audience and drive profile actions.

## When to Activate

Use this skill when:
- User asks to write or optimize their social media bio
- User mentions "LinkedIn headline", "Twitter bio", or "Instagram bio"
- User wants to update their professional profile descriptions
- User says "help me with my social profiles"
- User needs bios for multiple platforms

## Core Principles

1. **No Fabrication**: Do not create personal stories, anecdotes, experiences, or achievements unless explicitly provided by the user
2. **Evidence-Based**: All claims, metrics, and credentials must come directly from user input
3. **Multiple Options**: Generate 3-5 bio variations per platform to provide choice
4. **Platform Optimization**: Strictly adhere to each platform's character limits and best practices
5. **Conversion Focus**: Every bio should clearly communicate value and encourage profile actions

## Workflow

### Step 0: Load Context Profiles

Before starting, load all context profiles provided in the task.

If context profiles exist, use them for voice, business details, and target audience information.

If profiles don't exist, ask user for information directly (see Step 1).

### Step 1: Gather Additional Information

**Note:** If context profiles loaded, you have most information. Ask only for platform-specific details.

### Step 2: Generate Platform-Specific Bios

Generate 3-5 variations for each requested platform following the specifications below.

## LinkedIn Bios

## Content Generation Guidelines

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Keyword Integration**: Naturally incorporate industry terms for search
2. **Social Proof**: Use only verified metrics/achievements from user input
3. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Ensure value is immediately apparent
4. **Audience Language**: Mirror terminology used by target demographic
5. **Action Orientation**: Use present-tense, dynamic verbs

### Information Gap Handling

**If user provides limited information:**
- Request specific details needed
- Provide examples to clarify what you need
- Create template-style bios with [brackets] for them to fill
- Explain why each piece of information matters

**Never create fictional:**
- Achievements or metrics
- Client testimonials
- Credentials or affiliations
- Personal stories

## Quality Checks

Before presenting bios:
- [ ] All character counts are within platform limits
- [ ] No fabricated achievements or credentials
- [ ] Clear value proposition in each version
- [ ] Platform-appropriate formatting
- [ ] CTAs align with user's stated goals
- [ ] Consistent facts across all variations
- [ ] Keywords naturally integrated
- [ ] Specific and measurable (not vague)
- [ ] Avoid generic phrases like "passionate about" or "love what I do"

## Best Practices

**For all platforms:**
- Lead with value, not job title
- Use specifics over generalities
- Show results, not just activities
- Make it scannable and clear
- Include clear call-to-action
- Test multiple variations

**LinkedIn specific:**
- Optimize for search keywords
- Use first-person perspective in About
- Include links where relevant
- Update regularly based on focus changes

**Twitter specific:**
- Every character counts - be ruthless
- Use emojis strategically for visual breaks
- Consider what will stand out in timeline
- Update as your focus evolves

**Instagram specific:**
- Visual hierarchy matters - use line breaks
- Emoji at start of line creates structure
- Direct to link in bio with clear CTA
- Keep it simple and scannable

**Remember:** Your bio is often the first impression. Make it clear, compelling, and conversion-focused. Test different versions and update based on what resonates with your target audience.
