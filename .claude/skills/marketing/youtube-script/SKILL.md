# YouTube Script

Write video scripts that sound like a real person talking, not AI-generated content.

## Context Guidelines

- **Business context, audience, and other details:** Refer to any context profiles provided

---

## When to Use

- User needs a YouTube video script
- User asks for "script for my video" or "YouTube script"
- User has a topic and wants full spoken content
- User mentions needing content that "doesn't sound AI"

---

## The Problem with AI Scripts

Most AI-generated scripts fail because they:
- Use generic phrases ("In this video, I'll show you...")
- Lack personality and opinion
- Sound like blog posts read aloud
- Have no rhythm or pattern interrupts
- Miss the conversational element

**This skill fixes that.**

---

## Script Philosophy

### 1. Hook First, Always

Modern viewers decide in 3 seconds. Start with intensity:
- Bold claim that challenges assumptions
- Surprising fact or result
- Direct address of their pain point
- "What if" scenario

**Never start with:** "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel..."

### 2. Conversational, Not Written

Scripts should sound like talking, not reading:
- Use contractions (don't, won't, can't)
- Include filler phrases strategically ("Look," "Here's the thing," "So,")
- Write incomplete sentences when natural
- Add verbal callbacks ("Remember what I said earlier?")

### 3. Pattern Interrupts

Every 30-60 seconds, break the pattern:
- Ask a rhetorical question
- Make a surprising statement
- Use humor or self-deprecation
- Reference something unexpected
- Change energy or pace

### 4. Opinion Over Information

Generic: "There are several ways to do this."
Human: "Most people do this wrong. Here's what actually works."

Take positions. Be opinionated. That's what makes content memorable.

### 5. The "Would I Actually Say This?" Test

Read every line aloud. If you wouldn't say it in conversation, rewrite it.

## Script Structure

### Hook (0-15 seconds)

```
[BOLD OPENING LINE - challenges assumption or creates curiosity]

[Quick context - one sentence max]

[What they'll get / why they should keep watching]
```

**Examples:**
- "Stop using [common approach]. It's why your [thing] isn't working."
- "I spent [time/money] figuring this out so you don't have to."
- "What if I told you [surprising claim]?"

### Setup (15-60 seconds)

```
[Why this matters - connect to their pain]

[Your credibility on this topic - brief, not braggy]

[Quick roadmap - what's coming]
```

**Key:** Don't over-explain. Get to the value fast.

### Main Content (varies)

Break into clear sections. For each section:

```
[SECTION TITLE - say it clearly for timestamps]

[Key point - lead with the insight]

[Explanation - conversational, with examples]

[Pattern interrupt - question, humor, callback]

[Transition to next section]
```

**Structure tips:**
- 3-7 main sections for most videos
- Each section: 2-4 minutes typical
- Always include specific examples, not abstract concepts

### Closer (30-60 seconds)

```
[Quick recap - "So here's what we covered..."]

[Single most important takeaway]

[Call to action - specific, one thing]

[Sign-off - natural, not scripted-sounding]
```

## Voice Markers to Include

**Opening phrases:**
- "Look,"
- "Here's the thing—"
- "So,"
- "Okay, so"
- "Real talk:"

**Transitions:**
- "But here's where it gets interesting."
- "Now, you might be thinking..."
- "And this is the part most people miss."
- "Stay with me here."

**Pattern interrupts:**
- "I know, I know—but hear me out."
- "Sounds crazy, right?"
- "Wait, it gets better."
- "Quick sidebar—"

**Emphasis:**
- "This is key."
- "Read that again." (for on-screen text)
- "I can't stress this enough."
- "Most people skip this part."

**Closers:**
- "That's it. That's the whole thing."
- "Go try this. Seriously."
- "Let me know how it goes."

5. **Specific examples** — Real situations, tools, or scenarios
6. **Desired outcome** — What can they do after watching?
7. **Voice context** — Any ghostwriter skill or voice DNA to reference

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Sounds AI | Sounds Human |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Generic opening | "In this video, I'll show you 5 ways to..." | "Stop doing [X]. Here's what actually works." |
| Formal language | "It is important to note that..." | "Here's the thing—" |
| No opinion | "There are several approaches you could take." | "Most of these approaches are wrong. Do this instead." |
| Written style | "Furthermore, this methodology enables..." | "And this is where it gets good." |
| Weak transitions | "Next, we will discuss..." | "But here's the part most people miss." |
| Generic examples | "For example, you could..." | "Last week I tried this and here's what happened." |
| Robotic closer | "Thank you for watching. Please like and subscribe." | "Go try this. Seriously. Let me know what happens." |

## Example Hook Variations

**For a productivity video:**
- Generic: "In this video, I'll share 5 productivity tips."
- Human: "I used to work 12-hour days. Now I do more in 4. Here's what changed."

**For a tutorial:**
- Generic: "Today we'll learn how to use [tool]."
- Human: "Everyone's using [tool] wrong. Let me show you how it's actually supposed to work."

**For a review:**
- Generic: "In this video, I'll review [product]."
- Human: "I've spent $500 testing [products]. This is the only one worth buying."

## Working with Ghostwriter Skills

If the user has a ghostwriter skill in their system:

1. **Invoke it** for voice authenticity
2. **Adapt delivery markers** to match their natural patterns
3. **Use their vocabulary** and phrases
4. **Match their energy level** in the script

The script structure stays the same, but the voice becomes uniquely theirs.
