# Substack Notes Generator

## Overview

This skill generates high-performing Substack notes by applying proven structural patterns and psychological techniques while maintaining YOUR unique voice through context profiles.

**Critical distinction:** This skill uses STRUCTURAL PATTERNS and PSYCHOLOGY (not tone) that have been proven to work, expressed in YOUR authentic voice.

## When to Activate

Use this skill when:
- User wants to write a Substack note
- User mentions "create a note" or "write a post"
- User asks for short-form content for Substack
- User wants to share an insight, update, or piece of advice on Substack

## How It Works

### Step 1: Load Context Profiles (REQUIRED)

Before generating any note, you MUST load context profiles provided in the task.

### Step 2: Analyze Input & Choose Note Type

Analyze the input and select the best note type:

**1. Single-Punch Wisdom** - One powerful quotable statement (1-2 sentences)
**2. Income Proof Story** - Share results with vulnerable beginning (3-7 sentences)
**3. Pattern Observation** - "I've noticed..." authority-building insight (3-8 sentences)
**4. Contrarian Statement** - Challenge conventional wisdom (2-6 sentences)
**5. Problem → Solution Insight** - Identify issue + root cause + fix (3-6 sentences)
**6. Build-in-Public Update** - Transparent progress sharing (3-8 sentences)
**7. List-Based Tactical** - Actionable numbered/bulleted advice (4-12 sentences)
**8. Vulnerable Personal Story** - Deep connection through story (4-10 sentences)
**9. Philosophical Observation** - Life principle or worldview (2-5 sentences)
**10. Direct Advice** - Clear instruction with reasoning (2-5 sentences)

If user is unsure, recommend based on their goal:
- **Teaching** → List-Based Tactical or Problem → Solution
- **Building Authority** → Pattern Observation or Income Proof Story
- **Connection** → Vulnerable Story or Philosophical Observation
- **Quick Value** → Single-Punch Wisdom or Direct Advice
- **Transparency** → Build-in-Public Update
- **Positioning** → Contrarian Statement

### Psychological Techniques to Apply

**Authority Building:**

- Proof through results (specific numbers)
- Transparent journey (struggle → success)

**Connection Building:**
- Vulnerability (admit fears, failures)
- Shared frustration (acknowledge reader's experience)
- Permission giving ("You're allowed to...")

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Cognitive dissonance (contradict beliefs)
- Specificity (concrete numbers, examples)
- Future pacing (show what's possible)
- Honest tension ("It's working, but...")

## Length Guidelines

**Ultra-Short (1-2 sentences):** Maximum shareability, quotable wisdom
**Short (3-5 sentences):** Quick insight with context - MOST COMMON
**Medium (6-10 sentences):** Teaching or storytelling
**Long (10+ sentences):** Deep dives, comprehensive frameworks - RARE

**Default to 3-5 sentences unless the message demands more.**

## Examples

### Example 1: Pattern Observation (Problem-solving niche)
**User Request:** "I want to share what I've noticed about successful problem solvers"

**Generated Note:**
```
A pattern I've noticed in people who solve hard problems:

They don't start by googling solutions.

They sit with the problem. Write it down. Break it apart. Ask better questions.

Only then do they look for answers.

Most people skip straight to searching for solutions to problems they haven't fully understood.
```

### Example 2: Build-in-Public Update (Creator niche)
**User Request:** "Share progress on my new content system"

**Generated Note:**
```
Week 3 of building my content system:

Created 15 pieces this week. Took 6 hours total (used to take 20).

The secret: Templates + voice documentation + clear frameworks.

Still refining the process, but already seeing how this scales.

The system pays for itself in time savings.
```

### Example 3: Problem → Solution Insight (Generic productivity)
**User Request:** "Explain why people can't focus"

**Generated Note:**
```
You can't focus because you don't have a priority.

When everything feels important, nothing is important. Your brain doesn't know what to lock onto.

Solution: Pick ONE thing. Make everything else wait.

Clarity creates focus.
```

### Example 4: Income Proof Story (Freelancer niche)
**User Request:** "Share my freelancing journey results"

**Generated Note:**
```
My first 6 months freelancing: $0

Month 7: First client, $500 project

Month 12: $3K/month consistent

Month 18: $8K/month, booked out 3 months ahead

It didn't click overnight. But once it clicked, everything moved fast.
```

### Example 5: Contrarian Statement (Wellness niche)
**User Request:** "Challenge the 'hustle culture' mindset"

**Generated Note:**
```
You don't need to hustle harder.

You need to sleep better, eat cleaner, and stress less.

Everyone's optimizing for more output. Nobody's optimizing for better inputs.

Your energy determines your results more than your effort.
```

## What to Avoid

### Anti-Patterns (Never Do This)

**1. Vague Generalities**
❌ "Success takes time and hard work"
✅ "My first 6 months: $0. Month 7: $10K. Nothing happens, then everything happens."

**2. Humble-Bragging**
❌ "So grateful for this little win" [shows huge number]
✅ "Made $50K this month. Here's the mistake that cost me $30K of it."

**3. Clickbait Without Payoff**
❌ "This one thing changed everything" [no specifics]
✅ "Switched from hourly to value pricing. Doubled my income in 8 weeks."

**4. Generic Advice**
❌ "Work hard and believe in yourself"
✅ "Wake up at 5am. Complete your hardest task first. Ignore everything else until noon."

**5. Corporate Voice**
❌ "We're excited to announce our new offering"
✅ "Built something new. Tested it for 3 weeks. It works. Here's what it does."
