# Course Email Sequence Generator

## Overview

This skill generates a complete 20-email sequence optimized for selling online courses and digital products, based on proven methodology that has generated millions in revenue. The sequence balances education (emails 1-10) with sales (emails 11-20), addressing the core principle that most purchasing barriers are education problems, not price problems.

## Core Principle

**The bottleneck to purchase is almost always an education problem, not a sales problem.** Customers don't buy because they don't feel educated enough to make a confident decision—not because of price, credibility, or branding. This sequence solves that by providing massive value upfront, building trust, and systematically addressing objections.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Context Profiles

Before generating any emails, load all context profiles provided in the task.

### Step 2: Gather Course Information

Analyze the input for these details:

**Required:**
- Course/product name and core offering
- Target audience (3 archetypes: beginner, intermediate, advanced variations of the same person)
- 5-10 specific problems the course solves
- 3-5 desired outcomes students achieve
- Course modules and content overview
- Pricing information

**Highly Recommended:**
- Founder/creator story (transformation from where target audience is now)
- Student testimonials (especially transformation stories)
- Existing bonuses or ability to create new ones
- Common objections to purchase
- Quick tips or templates to give away

### Step 3: Generate Emails 1-10 (Education Phase)

**Focus:** Help the customer become aware of problems and feel empowered to solve them

1. **Email 1 - Plain Pitch**: Direct product introduction with problem/solution/purchase link
2. **Email 2 - Who This Is For**: Define 3 archetypes (beginner/started but stuck/experienced but leveling up)
3. **Email 3 - 10 Biggest Problems**: List problems target customer faces (you know because you had them too)
4. **Email 4 - 3-5 Desired Outcomes**: Paint the picture of life after solving these problems
5. **Email 5 - Your Story**: Show you've been exactly where they are (relatable, not boastful)
6. **Email 6 - Stop/Start**: Things to stop doing + things to start doing instead
7. **Email 7 - Myths & Faulty Beliefs**: Address psychological barriers keeping them stuck
8. **Email 8 - Quick Tips**: Actionable advice even if they don't buy (builds trust)
9. **Email 9 - Common Mistakes**: Warn about pitfalls when trying to solve alone
10. **Email 10 - Free Templates**: Give tangible resources that demonstrate value

### Step 4: Generate Emails 11-20 (Sales Phase)

**Focus:** Show specifically how your product helps them + overcome final objections

11. **Email 11 - Everything Included**: Comprehensive walkthrough linking features to problems solved
12. **Email 12 - Strategic Bonuses**: Address top 3 objections with bonus solutions
13. **Email 13 - Testimonial Roundup**: Social proof from happy customers
14. **Email 14 - One Year from Now**: Contrast two futures (with vs. without taking action)
15. **Email 15 - Deep Dive Testimonial**: Spotlight one transformation story
16. **Email 16 - Tale of Two Archetypes**: Fable-style story of two paths (action vs. inaction)
17. **Email 17 - What's Holding You Back**: Direct question with trackable objection links
18. **Email 18 - Behind the Scenes**: Video or detailed tour showing inside the product
19. **Email 19 - Disappearing Bonus**: Limited-time bonus addressing key objection (24-48hr urgency)
20. **Email 20 - Disappearing Discount**: Last resort discount (only after education complete)

### Step 5: Customize and Refine

- **Match voice:** Write in the founder's authentic voice from context profiles
- **Link everything:** Every feature mentioned should link back to a problem or outcome
- **Never blame the customer:** Blame faulty systems, education, or societal narratives
- **Create genuine urgency:** Make bonuses/discounts disappearing (real scarcity, not fake)
- **Include CTAs:** Every email should have clear next step (usually link to purchase page)

## Key Writing Principles

### Education Over Sales
- Give away massive value for free—the more you give, the more people want to buy
- Address objections through education, not aggressive selling
- Help customer feel confident in their decision-making ability

### Story as Context
- Your story matters only when it helps the reader relate to you
- Show "I've been exactly where you are" rather than "look how great I am now"
- Let readers see themselves in your story

### Problem-Outcome Link
- Don't talk about how great your product is
- Talk about how you help solve their problems to unlock their desired outcomes
- Let customers naturally assume your product is the bridge

### Overcome Objections with Bonuses
- Identify the 3 biggest objections preventing purchase
- Create bonuses that specifically address each objection
- Price anchor bonuses to show added value

### The No-Sell Sell
- The more value you provide, the more they want to buy
- Templates and quick tips create trust without pitching
- "Here's how to do it yourself" paradoxically increases sales

## Email Sequence Structure

**Emails 1-10 (70% education, 30% sales)**
- Primary goal: Make customer aware of problems and solutions
- Build trust through massive free value
- Establish credibility through expertise demonstration
- Light product mentions with focus on education

**Emails 11-20 (60% sales, 40% education)**
- Primary goal: Show exactly how product delivers transformation
- Address remaining objections systematically
- Create urgency with disappearing bonuses
- Use social proof and future pacing

## Sequence Deployment Rules

### Funnel Structure
1. **Free content on social platforms** drives traffic
2. **Free opt-in** (5-day email course or downloadable resource)
3. **20-email sequence** begins after opt-in completes (Day 6+)

### Email Frequency
- Send more emails, not fewer (proven correlation with revenue)
- Daily or every-other-day cadence works well
- Pull subscribers out of sequence immediately upon purchase
- Don't send discount emails to those who already bought earlier

### Why 20 Emails Works
- Most conversions happen after 15-20 emails, not 1-2
- Customers need time to process information and overcome objections
- Education takes time—rushing leads to lost sales
- Those who unsubscribe early weren't going to buy anyway

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Discounting too early:** Price is rarely the real objection—educate first
2. **Fear of unsubscribes:** Better to have 1,000 buyers than 100,000 non-buyers
3. **Product-focused copy:** Talk about problems/outcomes, not features
4. **Giving away too little:** Opposite is true—give away more to increase sales
5. **Skipping founder story:** Personal connection drives trust and relatability
6. **Generic bonuses:** Create bonuses that specifically address objections
7. **No urgency:** Make bonuses/discounts genuinely time-limited
8. **Forgetting CTAs:** Every email needs clear call-to-action

## Output Format

For each email, provide:
- **Subject line** (benefit-driven, curiosity-inducing, or direct)
- **Email body** (conversational tone, 200-500 words typical)
- **CTA** (clear next step with link placement)
- **Key principle applied** (which strategy this email uses)

Write in the founder's voice based on context profiles. Use "I/we" language to create personal connection. Include specific details from the course information provided.

**Usage:** Always read context profiles before generating emails to ensure authentic voice and precise audience targeting.

## Notes on Customization

- **Order flexibility:** Email order can be adjusted, but hitting all themes is critical
- **Length variation:** Adjust email length based on complexity (tips can be short, testimonials can be longer)
- **Multiple sequences:** Can create variations for different launch types (evergreen, cohort-based, flash sale)
- **A/B testing:** Generate multiple subject lines for testing
- **Segmentation:** Can modify emails based on subscriber behavior or characteristics
