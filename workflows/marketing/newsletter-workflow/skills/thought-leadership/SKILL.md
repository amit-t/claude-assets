# Newsletter: Thought Leadership

**Purpose:** Write value-packed, niche-specific, thought leadership weekly newsletters (800-1,500 words) that educate, engage, and position the writer as an authority.

## When to Activate

Use this skill when:
- User asks to write a newsletter or weekly email
- User mentions "thought leadership" or "educational newsletter"
- User wants to create value-packed content for their audience
- User provides a topic/idea and wants a full newsletter written
- User says "write my weekly email" or similar

## Core Philosophy

This is NOT basic email writing. This is:
- **Thought leadership** - establishing authority and expertise
- **Value-packed** - tangible, tactical, actionable content
- **Skim-optimized** - headers alone deliver 80% of value
- **Niche-specific** - targeted to specific audience needs

**Length**: 800-1,500 words

## The 4 Fundamental Variables

### Variable 1: Subject Line (Irresistible Headline)
### Variable 2: Introduction (Hook + Promise)
### Variable 3: Headers (3-10 sections, skimmable)
### Variable 4: Section Content (Tactical, actionable insights)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Context Profiles

Before starting, load all context profiles provided in the task.

### Step 2: Craft Subject Line Options

**Generate 5 subject line variations using the Irresistible Headline Framework:**

#### The 6-Piece Framework:
1. **HOW MANY** (Number) - Usually 2-19
2. **THE WHAT** (Topic) - The subject matter
3. **THE HOW** (Proven Approach) - Tips, Steps, Mistakes, Lessons, Benefits, Reasons, etc.
4. **THE WHO** (Audience) - Specific target reader
5. **THE WHY** (Outcome) - Tangible result they want
6. **TWIST THE KNIFE** (More Outcomes) - 1-3 additional outcomes

**Example**:
"7 Copywriting Tips For Beginners To Sell Your First $100 Digital Product, Start Making Money Online, And Eventually Quit Your Job"

#### Subject Line Requirements:
- **Length**: 30-50 characters or 4-8 words
- **Case**: sentence-case (first word capitalized, rest lowercase)
- **Exception**: If starts with number, don't capitalize next word
  - Good: "3 ways to land your first ghostwriting client"
  - Bad: "3 Ways To Land Your First Ghostwriting Client"

**Tangible vs. Intangible Outcomes:**
- ❌ Intangible: "So you can be happier"
- ✅ Tangible: "So you can wake up every morning feeling full of energy"

### Step 3: Write the Introduction (5 Blocks)

#### Block 1: Greeting
**Format**: "Hey there!" or similar friendly opening

#### Block 2: Opening Hook (1 sentence)
Choose ONE approach:
- Ask a thought-provoking question
- Strong, declarative sentence
- Reference a meaningful moment in time
- Present a vulnerable statement
- Offer a controversial opinion
- Share a unique insight

**Example**: "Do you want to know the secret to landing your first ghostwriting client?"

#### Block 3: The Promise (3-7 sentences OR bullets)
Educate on:
- **Problem**: The niche-specific problem(s) readers face, why they exist, negative outcomes
- OR **Outcome**: The desirable outcome(s) readers want, why valuable, consequences of not achieving

**Example**:
"One of the biggest challenges I faced getting started was: how do I actually charge for my work and make money? And the truth is, it's not that hard. It's just that no one tells you how to do it."

#### Block 4: The Solution (1-2 sentences)
State what you're going to help them with today.

**Example**: "So today, I'm going to share the 3 ways to structure your next ghostwriting project—and when to use them to get paid a premium."

#### Block 5: Transition (1 sentence)
Bridge to the main content.

**Examples**: "Let's walk through each one." / "Let's dive in!" / "So, with that in mind, let's solve that problem."

### Step 4: Create Headers (3-10 Sections)

#### The 10 Magical Ways to Expand Anything:
- Tips
- Stats
- Steps
- Lessons
- Benefits
- Reasons
- Mistakes
- Examples
- Questions
- Personal Stories

#### Header Guidelines:
- **Format**: Sentence Style - full complete sentence, first word capitalized, punctuation at end
- **Goal**: Deliver promise in headers alone (reader gets 80% value from just reading headers)
- **Bolded**: All headers should be bold (H3 format: ###)
- **Promise alignment**: Headers must clearly deliver on the promise from subject line/intro

**Good Example**:
```
### Way 1: Flat-rate, per project.
### Way 2: Monthly rate, per recurring service.
### Way 3: Up-front cash, plus performance.
```

**Number of sections**:
- More sections (7-10) = headers deliver most value, less detail in each section
- Fewer sections (3-5) = more room to elaborate tactically in each section

### Step 5: Write Section Content

#### Section Structure:
- **Opening**: Single-sentence opener
- **Middle**: Prose + ONE bulleted list per section (use sparingly)
- **Closing**: Single-sentence closer
- **Rhythm**: Alternate between long and short sentences for pacing

#### Content Criteria:
- **How-to focused**: Make it actionable/instructional (tips, steps, reasons, examples)
- **Why-focused**: Make it explanation-focused (stats, lessons, benefits, mistakes)
- **Specificity**: Very specific, tangible, tactical, differentiated insights
- **No fluff**: Every sentence should add value
- **Skimmable**: Easy to scan and extract value quickly

**Example Section**:
```
### Way 1: Flat-rate, per project.

Most ghostwriters should start here for their first project because it has a clear start and end date.

For example, the primary asset we train ghostwriters to write, build, and sell inside our Premium Ghostwriting Academy is a 5-Day Educational Email Course (EEC), which is a high-value opt-in for businesses and personal brands to capture emails on autopilot.

This is an asset that takes about a month to build—and we recommend ghostwriters charge a flat-rate of $5,000.

But there's a few other ghostwriting projects where a flat-rate makes sense. Some examples you might sell are:

- **Website Copy:** Once the website copy is created or "fixed," the project is usually considered done.
- **eBooks or Books:** These also have clear endpoints. Once the book is "done," you don't continue to tweak it.
- **Automated Email Sequences:** Once the sequence is live, there's usually no more tweaking needed.

By the way, here's 12 Email Ghostwriting Sequences you can sell for $3,000+ each: [link]

And when a project doesn't have a clear timeline, instead you'd use:

### Step 6: Format for Email Delivery

#### Email Formatting:
- Headers: Bold (### format or **text**)
- Paragraphs: Short (1-3 sentences max)
- Bullets: Use for lists of examples or options
- Links: Include where mentioned
- Italics: Use sparingly for emphasis
- White space: Line breaks between sections

## Output Format

**Present the newsletter as:**
