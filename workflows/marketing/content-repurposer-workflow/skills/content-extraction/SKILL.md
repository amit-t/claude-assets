# Content Extraction Skill

## Overview

This skill transforms long-form content into a comprehensive content pipeline. It produces detailed, organized tables of content ideas tailored to specific platforms, ready for writing agents to execute.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User has a transcript, video, article, or any long-form content
- User wants to extract multiple content pieces from one source
- User needs organized, actionable content ideas by platform
- User wants to maximize the value from existing content

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Context Profiles

Before extracting content, load context profiles to understand:
- **ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)** - Who is the content for? What problems do they have? What language do they use?
- **Business Profile** - What does the user sell/offer? What positioning should content reinforce?
- **Voice DNA** - What tone and style should be reflected in the content ideas?

This context ensures all extracted ideas resonate with the target audience.

### Step 2: Clarify Platform Targets

Ask the user which platforms they want content for:

```
Which platforms do you want content ideas for? (Select all that apply)

- Newsletters (thought leadership, how-to guides)
- Substack Notes (short-form insights)
- Twitter/X (threads and standalone posts)
- LinkedIn (professional posts)
- YouTube Shorts / Reels (short-form video)
- Other (specify)

Also helpful to know:
- How many ideas per platform do you want? (Default: 5-10)
- Any specific angles or themes to prioritize?
```

### Step 3: Deep Content Analysis

Analyze the source content looking for:

**High-Value Insights**
- Unique perspectives not commonly shared
- Contrarian takes with solid reasoning
- "Aha moments" that shift thinking
- Quotable statements

**Teachable Content**
- Step-by-step processes
- Frameworks and mental models
- How-to instructions
- Tips and tactics

**Stories & Examples**
- Personal experiences
- Case studies
- Before/after transformations
- Mistakes and lessons learned

**Data & Proof Points**
- Statistics and numbers
- Results and outcomes
- Comparisons and benchmarks

**Emotional Hooks**
- Pain points addressed
- Aspirations touched
- Fears acknowledged
- Desires activated

### Step 4: Map Ideas to Platforms

Different content works better on different platforms:

| Content Type | Best Platforms |
|--------------|----------------|
| Deep frameworks | Newsletter, LinkedIn article |
| Quick tips | Twitter, Substack Notes |
| Step-by-step processes | Newsletter (how-to), Twitter thread |
| Personal stories | LinkedIn, Newsletter |
| Contrarian takes | Twitter, Substack Notes |
| Data/stats | LinkedIn, Twitter |
| Quotable wisdom | Substack Notes, Twitter |
| Visual concepts | Short-form video |

### Step 5: Generate Platform Tables

For each selected platform, produce a detailed table with platform-specific fields.

## Quality Standards

Every extracted idea must:

**Be Traceable**
- Directly sourced from the content (not invented)
- Include enough context to be standalone

**Be Specific**
- Not "write about topic X"
- Includes hook, angle, key points

**Be Platform-Native**
- Formatted for how that platform works
- Right length and structure

**Be Audience-Aligned**
- Speaks to ICP pain points
- Uses their language
- Addresses their aspirations

**Be Actionable**
- Detailed enough for a writing agent to execute
- No ambiguity about the angle or approach

---

## Tips for Maximum Extraction

1. **One source, many angles** - The same insight can become a newsletter deep-dive AND a punchy tweet AND a LinkedIn story

2. **Repurpose, don't repeat** - Each platform version should feel native, not copy-pasted

3. **Lead with pain points** - Ideas that address ICP struggles will always outperform

4. **Include contrarian takes** - These drive engagement across all platforms

5. **Don't force it** - If the source doesn't have enough meat for a platform, note it rather than creating weak ideas
