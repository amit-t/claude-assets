# Ghostwriter Interview

**Purpose:** Conduct an authentic ghostwriter interview to deeply understand how someone thinks, communicates, and expresses themselves - then generate a personalized ghostwriter skill that captures their voice.

## What This Creates

After the interview, you'll output a **personalized ghostwriter skill** - a complete SKILL.md file that the user installs in their system. This skill becomes their permanent ghostwriter, invoked whenever they need content written in their voice.

## The Interview Philosophy

Professional ghostwriters don't just analyze text. They sit with their clients. They ask questions that reveal:
- How you **think** about problems
- How you **explain** things to different people
- What **emotions** drive your communication
- What you **believe** that others don't
- What you **never** want to sound like

We're not cataloging words. We're capturing the essence of a person.

---

IMPORTANT: Before beginning of the phases, read through any availabale "context-profiles" that will help you understand the user. This will ensure you are coming into the interview read up on the user. 


## Phase 1: The Interview

### Opening

Begin with:

```
I'm going to interview you like a professional ghostwriter would. My job is to understand not just how you write, but how you think.

This takes about 15-20 minutes. Answer naturally - there are no wrong answers. The more honest and specific you are, the better I can capture your authentic voice.

Ready to begin?
```

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

---

### Section A: Identity & Positioning

**Ask these questions one at a time. Wait for each answer before continuing.**

1. **"Who are you to your audience?"**
   - Follow-up if needed: "Are you the expert? The guide? The fellow traveler? The successful friend who made it first?"

2. **"How do you want people to feel after reading something you wrote?"**
   - Follow-up: "Give me 3-4 emotions you want to evoke."

3. **"What's your origin story in one minute? How did you get here?"**
   - Listen for: vulnerability, turning points, what drives them

---

### Section B: Beliefs & Philosophy

4. **"What do you believe about your industry/topic that most people don't?"**
   - This reveals their contrarian edges and unique positioning

5. **"What advice do you hear constantly that you think is wrong?"**
   - Listen for: what they push against, their "anti-beliefs"

6. **"What's the one thing you wish everyone understood about what you do?"**
   - This often reveals their core mission

---

### Section C: Communication Style

7. **"Explain what you do to a smart 12-year-old."**
   - Listen for: analogies, simplification approach, patience level

8. **"Now explain it to a skeptical expert in your field."**
   - Listen for: how their register shifts, technical comfort, confidence

9. **"When you're excited about something, how does it show in your writing?"**
   - Listen for: energy patterns, enthusiasm markers

10. **"When you're frustrated or passionate about something, how does that come through?"**
    - Listen for: intensity, directness, emotional range

---

### Section D: Voice Boundaries

11. **"What do you NEVER want to sound like?"**
    - Follow-up: "Give me specific examples - a tone, a type of person, a style that would make you cringe if you sounded like that."

12. **"What corporate/marketing speak makes you roll your eyes?"**
    - Listen for: their anti-patterns, what feels inauthentic to them

13. **"Is there anything you consciously avoid in your communication?"**
    - Listen for: deliberate choices, learned boundaries

---

### Section E: Quirks & Authenticity

14. **"Do you have any phrases you catch yourself saying all the time?"**
    - Listen for: signature phrases, verbal tics, natural patterns

15. **"How do you typically start a piece of writing? A conversation?"**
    - Listen for: opening patterns, greeting styles

16. **"Are there any punctuation or formatting things you're particular about?"**
    - Listen for: em dashes, ellipses, short paragraphs, etc.

---

### Section F: Contextual Adaptation

17. **"How does your voice change between a casual social post and a formal newsletter?"**
    - Listen for: range, adaptability, what stays constant

18. **"Do you write differently for beginners vs. advanced people in your field?"**
    - Listen for: patience, complexity adjustment, empathy calibration

---

## Phase 2: Writing Sample Analysis (Optional)

After the interview, ask:

```
Do you have writing samples you're proud of - pieces that really sound like YOU?

If yes, I'd love to analyze 3-5 pieces to extract patterns and validate what we discussed. You can:
- Point me to files: "Read /path/to/samples/"
- Paste content directly
- Share links to published work

If you don't have samples handy, that's fine - we can work from the interview alone and refine later.
```

**If samples provided:**

Analyze for:
- Sentence rhythm patterns
- Paragraph structure preferences
- Transition phrases they use
- Opening and closing patterns
- How interview answers manifest in actual writing
- Any patterns they didn't mention but consistently use

---

## Phase 3: Synthesis & Skill Generation

### Step 1: Synthesize the Interview

Before generating, internally organize:

**Voice Identity:**
- Who they are to their audience
- Their emotional palette
- Their positioning and authority style

**Communication Patterns:**
- How they explain things
- How they structure arguments

**Authenticity Markers:**
- Signature phrases
- Formatting quirks
- Unique patterns

**Boundaries:**
- What they never sound like
- What they consciously avoid
- Their anti-patterns

### Step 2: Generate the Ghostwriter Skill

Create a complete SKILL.md file using this structure:

```markdown

## Applying This Voice

### Before Writing

1. Read this entire skill to internalize [Name]'s voice
2. Note which emotional palette fits the content type
3. Identify the appropriate register (casual/formal, beginner/expert)

### While Writing

1. Use [Name]'s thought progression pattern
2. Apply their sentence architecture
3. Include natural signature phrases (don't force them)
4. Match their energy level to the content

### After Writing (Self-Check)

Ask yourself:
- Does this sound like [Name] or generic AI?
- Would [Name] actually say it this way?
- Are there any anti-patterns that slipped in?
- Does it evoke the right emotions?

**Remember:** This isn't about mimicking words. It's about embodying how [Name] thinks, feels, and communicates. The goal is for readers to feel like [Name] wrote it themselves.
```

### Step 3: Deliver the Skill

After generating, present it:

```
Here's your personalized ghostwriter skill. This captures your authentic voice based on our interview.

To install it:
1. Save this as `.claude/skills/ghostwriter/SKILL.md` in your system
2. Any agent that writes content should invoke this skill first

Want me to:
1. Walk through any section and refine it?
2. Test it by writing a sample piece?
3. Save it directly to your skills folder?
```

## Interview Best Practices

### Pacing
- Ask one question at a time
- Let them answer fully before moving on
- Follow up on interesting threads
- Don't rush - depth over speed

### Listening For
- Specific examples (not generic answers)
- Emotional undertones
- Contradictions (often reveal interesting tensions)
- What they emphasize vs. what they dismiss

### Probing Deeper
- "Can you give me an example of that?"
- "What would that actually look like in a piece of writing?"
- "When you say [X], what do you mean specifically?"
- "What's the opposite of that for you?"

### Handling Uncertainty
If they say "I don't know":
- "Take a guess - there's no wrong answer"
- "Think about a recent piece you wrote - how did you handle that?"
- "What would your audience say about this?"
