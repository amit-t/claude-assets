# Social Media Bio Generator

**Purpose:** Generate multiple high-converting bio options for LinkedIn, X (Twitter), and Instagram that attract the right audience and drive profile actions.

## When to Activate

Use this skill when:
- User asks to write or optimize their social media bio
- User mentions "LinkedIn headline", "Twitter bio", or "Instagram bio"
- User wants to update their professional profile descriptions
- User says "help me with my social profiles"
- User needs bios for multiple platforms

## Core Principles

1. **No Fabrication**: Do not create personal stories, anecdotes, experiences, or achievements unless explicitly provided by the user
2. **Evidence-Based**: All claims, metrics, and credentials must come directly from user input
3. **Multiple Options**: Generate 3-5 bio variations per platform to provide choice
4. **Platform Optimization**: Strictly adhere to each platform's character limits and best practices
5. **Conversion Focus**: Every bio should clearly communicate value and encourage profile actions

## Workflow

### Step 0: Load Context Profiles

Before starting, load all context profiles provided in the task.

If context profiles exist, use them for business details, and target audience information.

If profiles don't exist, ask user for information directly (see Step 1).

### Step 1: Gather Additional Information

**Note:** If context profiles loaded, you have most information. Ask only for platform-specific details.

**Ask the user:**

**If context profiles loaded:**
```
I've loaded your context profiles. I have your core information!

Which platforms do you need bios for?
- LinkedIn (headline + about section)
- X (Twitter)
- Instagram

Just need to know:
1. **Primary goal** for these profiles? (leads, opportunities, brand awareness, etc.)
2. **Call-to-action preference**? (newsletter, website, booking, etc.)
3. **Any specific tone adjustments** for these platforms? (or use voice DNA defaults)

That's all - I'll create platform-optimized bios using your context!
```

**If no context profiles:**
```
I'll help you create high-converting bios optimized for LinkedIn, X (Twitter), and Instagram.

Which platforms do you need bios for? (Select all that apply)
- LinkedIn (headline + about section)
- X (Twitter)
- Instagram

To create effective bios, please provide:

**Essential Information:**
1. Current role/title
2. Target audience (who do you want to attract?)
3. What you do / expertise areas
4. Unique value proposition (what makes you different?)
5. Primary goal for your profile (leads, job opportunities, brand awareness, etc.)

**Helpful Details:**
6. Key achievements with specific metrics (revenue, followers, clients, etc.)
7. Credentials or affiliations
8. Current projects or offerings
9. Topics you're known for
10. Call-to-action preference (newsletter, website, booking, etc.)
11. Preferred tone (professional, casual, bold, etc.)

Provide as much detail as you can - the more context, the better the bios!
```

### Step 2: Generate Platform-Specific Bios

Generate 3-5 variations for each requested platform following the specifications below.

## LinkedIn Bios

### Headline Section (220 characters max)

**Structure Formula**: [What You Do] | [Who You Help] | [Unique Value/Differentiator]

**Create 3-5 headline variations:**

**Variation Approaches:**
- **Variation 1**: Focus on helping specific audience achieve measurable outcome

**Requirements:**

- Include ONE credibility marker (role, achievement, or metric from user data)
- Add 2-3 topic hashtags or focus areas
- Write for search optimization with relevant keywords
- **Avoid**: Job title only, vague descriptions, clever over clear

**Example Format:**
```
I help [audience] achieve [outcome] | [Credential/Role] | Topics: [keyword1], [keyword2], [keyword3]
```

### About/Summary Section (2,600 characters max)

**Format Options:**

**Create 3-5 Twitter bio variations:**

- **Variation 2**: Achievement-first with follower benefit
- **Variation 3**: Action-oriented "Building/Creating X" focus
- **Variation 4**: Topic expertise with credibility marker
- **Variation 5**: Minimalist high-impact statement

```
[Moniker] | [What I do] | [Topics] | [Proof point]

[Role] • [Mission]
[Topics] • [Value delivered]

## Content Generation Guidelines

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Keyword Integration**: Naturally incorporate industry terms for search
2. **Social Proof**: Use only verified metrics/achievements from user input
3. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Ensure value is immediately apparent
4. **Audience Language**: Mirror terminology used by target demographic
5. **Action Orientation**: Use present-tense, dynamic verbs

### Information Gap Handling

**If user provides limited information:**
- Request specific details needed
- Provide examples to clarify what you need
- Create template-style bios with [brackets] for them to fill
- Explain why each piece of information matters

**Never create fictional:**
- Achievements or metrics
- Client testimonials
- Credentials or affiliations
- Personal stories

## Output Format

**Present bios clearly labeled by platform:**

```

```

## Quality Checks

Before presenting bios:
- [ ] All character counts are within platform limits
- [ ] No fabricated achievements or credentials
- [ ] Clear value proposition in each version
- [ ] Platform-appropriate formatting
- [ ] CTAs align with user's stated goals
- [ ] Consistent facts across all variations
- [ ] Keywords naturally integrated
- [ ] Specific and measurable (not vague)
- [ ] Avoid generic phrases like "passionate about" or "love what I do"

## Example Interaction

**User:** "I need bios for LinkedIn and Twitter. I'm a content strategist who helps B2B companies with thought leadership. I've worked with 50+ companies and my content has generated 10M+ views."

**Claude (using this skill):**
```
Great! I'll create optimized bios for LinkedIn and Twitter.

A few more questions to make these perfect:

1. Who's your target audience? (e.g., "B2B marketing leaders", "SaaS founders")
2. What's your unique approach or methodology?
3. What do you want people to do? (connect, visit website, book call, etc.)
4. Any specific credentials or notable clients you want to mention?
5. Preferred tone? (authoritative, approachable, bold, etc.)

Once I have these details, I'll create 3-5 options for each platform!
```

## Best Practices

**For all platforms:**
- Lead with value, not job title
- Use specifics over generalities
- Show results, not just activities
- Make it scannable and clear
- Include clear call-to-action
- Test multiple variations

**LinkedIn specific:**
- Optimize for search keywords
- Use first-person perspective in About
- Include links where relevant
- Update regularly based on focus changes

**Twitter specific:**
- Every character counts - be ruthless
- Use emojis strategically for visual breaks
- Consider what will stand out in timeline
- Update as your focus evolves

**Instagram specific:**
- Visual hierarchy matters - use line breaks
- Emoji at start of line creates structure
- Direct to link in bio with clear CTA
- Keep it simple and scannable

---

**Remember:** Your bio is often the first impression. Make it clear, compelling, and conversion-focused. Test different versions and update based on what resonates with your target audience.
