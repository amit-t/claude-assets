# LinkedIn Profile Optimizer

**Purpose:** Transform LinkedIn profiles from basic online resumes into powerful personal branding tools that convert visitors into connections and opportunities.

## When to Activate

Use this skill when:
- User asks to optimize their LinkedIn profile
- User mentions "LinkedIn headline", "LinkedIn about section", or specific profile elements
- User wants to attract clients, recruiters, or opportunities via LinkedIn
- User says "improve my LinkedIn" or "LinkedIn profile help"
- User wants comprehensive profile audit and optimization plan

## Core Principle

**LinkedIn profiles should be personal branding tools, not resumes.**

Based on Justin Welsh's proven 8-step framework:
1. Professional Headshot
2. Banner Design
3. Headline Optimization
4. Featured Section
5. About Section
6. Experience Section
7. Content Strategy
8. Recommendations

## Critical: No Fabrication

- **Never create** fictional achievements, metrics, or experiences
- **Only use** information user explicitly provides
- **If gaps exist**: Provide frameworks and ask for details
- **Be adaptive**: Work with whatever level of information user provides

## Workflow

### Step 0: Load Context Profiles

Before starting, load all context profiles provided in the task.

If context profiles exist, use them for business details, and target audience information.

If profiles don't exist, ask user for information directly (see Step 1).

### Step 1: Gather Additional User Information

**Note:** If context profiles loaded, you already have most core information. Ask only for LinkedIn-specific details not in profiles.

**Ask the user:**

**If context profiles loaded:**
```
I've loaded your context profiles. I have your core information!

For LinkedIn optimization, I just need a few LinkedIn-specific details:

1. **Current LinkedIn state**: What's your current headline? About section? (or "starting fresh")
2. **Primary LinkedIn goal**: Leads, job opportunities, thought leadership, partnerships?
3. **LinkedIn-specific assets**: Do you have a professional headshot? Banner image? Featured items to showcase?
4. **Current photo description**: (if you have one)
5. **Competitor profiles you admire**: Any LinkedIn profiles that inspire you?

That's all I need - I'll use your context profiles for the content!
```

**If no context profiles:**
```
I'll help you optimize your LinkedIn profile using a proven 8-step framework.

Since I can't access LinkedIn directly and don't have context profiles yet, please describe:

**Core Information:**
1. Current role/title
2. Industry/niche
3. Years of experience
4. Core expertise areas
5. Target audience (who do you want to attract?)
6. Primary LinkedIn goal (leads, jobs, thought leadership, etc.)

**Business/Brand:**
7. Company name and what you do
8. Products/services offered
9. Target customer profile
10. Unique value proposition

**Existing Assets:**
11. Current headline (if any)
12. About section (if any)
13. Notable achievements or metrics
14. Client testimonials or feedback
15. Website or portfolio
16. Content topics you're knowledgeable about

Optional but helpful:
- Current photo description
- Competitor profiles you admire
- Media features or recognition

**Provide as much detail as possible - I'll create specific recommendations based on what you share!**
```

### Step 2: Determine Output Level

**Assess information provided:**

**Minimal Input** → Provide:
- Profile audit checklist
- Information gathering worksheet
