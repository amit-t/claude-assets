**Template:**
```
Subject: I used to [struggle with same problem]

I need to be honest with you.

A few years ago, I was exactly where you are right now.

**Template:**
```
Subject: 5 myths keeping you stuck

Over the years, I've noticed the same faulty beliefs keep people from [desired outcome].

Let me clear some of these up:

**Myth #1: [Common belief]**
A lot of people think [belief]. I don't blame you if you believe this—[external reason for belief].

But here's the truth: [reality]. The actual barrier isn't [what they think], it's [real issue].

**Myth #2: [Common belief about self]**
You might be thinking "[self-limiting belief]."

Let me tell you something: that's not true. The real issue is [external factor/lack of knowledge]. You're not [negative trait], you're just [missing specific thing].

**Myth #3: [Belief about time/difficulty]**
The story you might be telling yourself: "[excuse/fear]."

Here's what's really going on: [psychological insight]. This fear is rooted in [underlying cause], not in reality.

**Myth #4: [Belief about readiness]**
"I'm not ready yet. I need to [prerequisite] first."

Here's the truth: You'll never feel fully ready. [Insight about taking action before feeling ready]. The people succeeding aren't more ready—they're just [doing it anyway].

**Myth #5: [Belief about who can succeed]**
"This works for other people, but [reason it won't work for me]."

I've seen [thousands/hundreds] of people just like you succeed with [approach]. The commonality isn't [talent/background]—it's [willingness/process/support].

There are two [target people]. We'll call them Alex and Jordan.

They both want to [desired outcome]. They both struggle with [same problems]. They both discover [Product Name] at the same time.

**Alex's path:**

Alex reads all the emails. Thinks "This looks great." But then [excuse #1]. And [excuse #2]. Alex thinks "Maybe next time" and closes the tab.

Weeks pass. Alex is still [stuck in same place]. Still thinking about [goal]. Still dealing with [same frustrations].

Months pass. Alex sees people posting about [achieving the outcome]. "Must be nice," Alex thinks. "Maybe I should finally do something about this."

A year passes. Alex is basically in the same place, maybe a little more frustrated, definitely more behind.

**Jordan's path:**

Jordan reads the same emails. Has the same doubts. But Jordan thinks: "What if I just go for it?"

Jordan joins [Product Name]. Week 1 is challenging—there's a learning curve. But Jordan keeps showing up.

Week 2, something clicks. Jordan [small win]. Week 3, [another win]. Week 4, Jordan [breakthrough].

Month 2, Jordan is [tangible progress]. People start noticing. Jordan is becoming [new identity].

Six months later, Jordan has [major result]. A year later, Jordan can't believe [he/she] almost didn't start.

---

Alex and Jordan are the same person. Same starting point. Same obstacles. Same fears.

Which person do you want to be?

### Email 19: Disappearing Bonus (48-Hour Urgency)

**Purpose:** Create genuine urgency with limited-time bonus

**Structure:**
- Acknowledge you've heard a specific objection
- Introduce bonus specifically designed to address it
- Price anchor the bonus
- Make it time-limited (24-48 hours)
- Clear deadline
- Strong CTA

**Critical Rules:**
- Bonus should be genuinely valuable and relevant
- Only offer to people who haven't bought yet
- Make urgency real (actually remove after deadline)
- Price anchor appropriately

**Template:**
```
Subject: [Bonus Name] - Only available for 48 hours

I've been hearing from a lot of people who say:

"[Specific objection that's preventing purchase]"

I get it. [Empathetic acknowledgment].

So here's what we did:

We created [Bonus Name]—a [description of bonus] specifically designed for [people with that objection].

**What is [Bonus Name]?**

[Bonus] includes:
- [Component 1 that addresses the objection]
- [Component 2 that addresses the objection]
- [Component 3 that addresses the objection]

[Detailed description of how it solves their specific problem]

If we sold this as a standalone product, it would be $[price anchor].

But here's the thing:

**For the next 48 hours only, if you join [Product Name], you get [Bonus Name] included for free.**

After [specific date/time], this bonus goes away. Forever.

It won't be available to purchase separately. It won't be added back later. This is the only chance to get it.

Here's what you get:
- Complete [Product Name] program ($[value])
- [Bonus Name] ($[value])
- [Other bonuses] ($[value])

**Total value: $[sum]**
**Your investment: $[actual price]**

But only if you join in the next 48 hours.

Deadline: [Specific day, date, time, timezone]

Join now: [LINK]

[Signature]

P.S. This is the only time we're offering [Bonus Name]. After [deadline], it's gone.

### Email 20: Disappearing Discount (Final Resort)

**Purpose:** Last-chance offer for price-sensitive buyers

**Structure:**
- Acknowledge this is the last email
- Offer limited-time discount
- Frame as "don't want price to be barrier"
- Clear urgency (24-48 hours)
- Reiterate full value
- Strong final CTA

**Critical Philosophy:**
- Only use after all 19 education/sales emails
- Discount is last resort, not first offer
- Only applies to people who haven't bought
- Pull them from sequence immediately upon purchase

**Important Note:**
Many successful programs NEVER offer discounts. They create disappearing bonuses instead (Email 19 style). Consider whether a discount aligns with your brand and pricing strategy.

**Template:**
```
Subject: Last chance: [Product Name] at [X]% off

This is my last email about [Product Name].

Over the past [X weeks/days], I've shared:
- [Quick recap of education provided]
- [Everything about the product]
- [Testimonials and proof]

You haven't joined yet, and I want to make sure price isn't the barrier.

So here's what I'm going to do:

**For the next 48 hours only, you can join [Product Name] at [X]% off.**

Instead of $[regular price], you pay $[discounted price].

That's $[savings] in savings.

But this offer expires in 48 hours: [Specific deadline with timezone]

Here's what you're getting:
- [Core product]
- [Bonus 1]
- [Bonus 2]
- [Everything else]

**Regular price: $[X]**
**Your price (for next 48 hours): $[Y]**
**You save: $[Z]**

This is it. After [deadline], the price goes back to $[regular price] and this offer disappears.

Join now: [LINK]

I hope to see you inside,
[Signature]

P.S. Seriously, this is the last chance. After [deadline], I won't email you about [Product Name] again. Don't let price be the reason you stay stuck.
```

## Writing Best Practices Across All Emails

### Voice & Tone
- **Conversational:** Write like you're talking to a friend
- **Direct:** Don't hedge or use corporate speak
- **Personal:** Use "I" and "you" liberally
- **Authentic:** Share real struggles and doubts
- **Confident but humble:** You know your stuff, but you've been where they are

### Subject Lines
- **Benefit-driven:** "How to [achieve outcome]"
- **Curiosity-inducing:** "The one thing nobody tells you about [topic]"
- **Direct:** "[Product Name]: Everything you get"
- **Personal:** "Can I be honest with you?"
- **Urgent (when appropriate):** "48 hours left: [Bonus Name]"
- **Question-based:** "What's keeping you on the fence?"

### Calls to Action
- **Clear and specific:** "Join [Product Name] here: [LINK]"
- **Low friction:** "Click here to see inside: [LINK]"
- **Multiple throughout email:** Start, middle, and end
- **Reply-friendly:** "Questions? Just reply to this email"
- **Time-bound (when urgent):** "Join before [deadline]: [LINK]"

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Being too salesy:** Focus on education, especially emails 1-10
2. **Feature dumping:** Always link features to problems/outcomes
3. **Neglecting emotion:** Logical + emotional = decision
4. **Generic language:** Be specific with problems and outcomes
5. **Forgetting CTAs:** Every email should have clear next step
6. **Blaming the customer:** Blame systems, education, circumstances—never them
7. **Fake urgency:** Make deadlines and scarcity real
8. **Underselling bonuses:** Price anchor and explain value clearly
9. **Ignoring objections:** Address them head-on throughout
10. **Making it about you:** Your story is only valuable when it helps them relate

### Length Guidelines
- **Emails 1-10:** 250-500 words (pure value, not too long)
- **Emails 11-15:** 300-600 words (more comprehensive)
- **Emails 16-20:** 250-400 words (urgency requires brevity)
- **Exception:** Deep dive testimonial (Email 15) can be longer

### Personalization Opportunities
- Use subscriber's first name when available
- Reference their specific situation if known
- Segment by behavior (opened but didn't click, clicked but didn't buy)
- Adjust archetype focus based on who you're writing to
- Mention their industry/role if relevant

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Timing Between Emails
- **Evergreen funnel:** Daily emails or every-other-day
- **Launch sequence:** Can compress to 2 emails per day
- **Best practice:** Consistent timing (same time each day)

### Automation Setup
- **Entry point:** After completing free opt-in (lead magnet)
- **Exit trigger:** Purchase (remove from sequence immediately)
- **Email service provider:** ConvertKit, MailChimp, ActiveCampaign, etc.
- **Tagging:** Tag based on which email converted them

### A/B Testing Opportunities
- **Subject lines:** Test 2-3 versions of high-impact emails
- **CTA placement:** Above fold vs. bottom
- **Social proof:** Which testimonials resonate most
- **Objection focus:** Which objections matter most
- **Bonus presentation:** How bonuses are framed

### Metrics to Track
- **Open rate:** Aim for 40%+ (good subject lines + engaged list)
- **Click rate:** Aim for 10%+ on sales emails
- **Conversion rate:** Track which email converts (usually 11-20)
- **Revenue per subscriber:** Total revenue / total subscribers
- **Unsubscribe rate:** <1% is healthy (higher means list quality issues)
