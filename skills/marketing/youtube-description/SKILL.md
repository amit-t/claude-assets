# YouTube Description

Generate high-converting YouTube video descriptions that improve discoverability and drive action.

## Context Guidelines

- **Business context, audience, and other details:** Refer to any context profiles provided

---

## When to Use

- User is publishing a new YouTube video
- User asks for a "YouTube description" or "video description"
- User has a video transcript or outline and needs upload copy
- User mentions timestamps or YouTube SEO

---

## Description Philosophy

YouTube descriptions serve multiple purposes:
1. **Hook viewers** who read before clicking
2. **Improve SEO** through keywords and context
3. **Drive action** with links and CTAs
4. **Provide value** with timestamps and resources

Most descriptions fail by being either too generic or too long. The goal is punchy, scannable, and action-driving.

4. **What they'll learn/get** — Specific outcomes
5. **Timestamps** — Section breakdowns (if provided)
6. **Resources mentioned** — Links, downloads, paid content
